The dataset consists of 1000 samples. There are 2 variations of the  dataset: </p> <ul> <li>German Data: Contains both categorical and numerical features. </li> <li>German Data Numeric: Categorical features are encoded as numerical values.  Suitable for models that require numerical inputs. </li> </ul> <p>This project uses the original German Data with categorical features. </p>"},{"location":"eda/dataset_overview/#features","title":"FEATURES","text":"<p>The dataset contains 20 features and a target variable. The features are a mix of  categorical and numerical variables: </p> Feature Name Type Description Checking_account_status Categorical Status of existing checking account Duration_months Numerical Duration in months Credit_history Categorical Credit history of the applicant Purpose Categorical Purpose of the credit Credit_amount Numerical Amount of credit Savings_account_bonds Categorical Savings account or bonds Employment_since Categorical Present employment duration Installment_rate Numerical Installment rate in % of disposable income Personal_status_sex Categorical Personal status and sex Other_debtors_guarantors Categorical Other debtors or guarantors Residence_since Numerical Present residence duration in years Property Categorical Type of property Age_years Numerical Age of the applicant Other_installment_plans Categorical Other installment plans (e.g. bank, stores) Housing Categorical Type of housing Existing_credits Numerical Number of existing credits at this bank Job Categorical Job category Maintenance_people Numerical Number of people liable for maintenance Telephone Categorical Presence of telephone (registered under the customer's name or not) Foreign_worker Categorical Whether the applicant is a foreign worker <p>The next step is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the  underlying patterns and relationships in the data.

As an attempt to simulate a real world scenario, the EDA has been performed with the dataset converted to a  SQL database. The EDA is performed using SQL queries to extract the data and matplotlib  to visualize it. For more details on the queries used please refer to the  queries section. </p> <p>Here are the graphs generated during the EDA: </p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"eda/exploration/#key-findings","title":"\ud83d\udcc8 Key Findings","text":"<p>The first thing to notice is the imbalance in the target variable. 70% of the  applicants have a good credit risk, while 30% have a bad credit risk. This is  a common scenario in real world datasets, where the positive class outnumbers the negative one. When training the model, it will be important to keep this in mind,  as class balancing techniques may be needed. Also, accuracy and recall analysis  will be important to ensure that the model is not biased towards the majority  class.</p> <p>When looking at the credit amount, the mean amount is around 4.000 for bad risk  applicants, and around 3.000 for good risk applicants. This suggests that credit  amount could be a good feature to use in the model. </p> <p>The age most frequent age group in the dataset is the 25-34 segment, which is  somewhat expected, as this is the age group that is most likely to apply for a  credit. Looking at the personal status, the majority of the applicants are single  men (A93). Something that stands out is the absence of A95 applicants(female,  single). This suggests that, fore some reason, single men are more likely to  apply for a credit than single women. However, this issue is not within the scope  of this project. </p> <p>In terms of housing, the majority of the applicants are owners (A152). Being an  owner may be a good indicator of good credit risk, as the majority of the  applicants who fall into this category have a good credit risk. On the other hand,  both A151 (renting) and A153 (for free) don't have enough data to draw any  conclusions. </p> <p>50% of the applicants are type A32 in credit history, which means they have paid  all their previous credits. This could be a good indicator of good credit risk, but it would not be prudent to draw any conclusions based on this alone. </p> <p>Looking at the guarantor types, the distributions is quite even, so this variable  is not likely to be a good indicator of credit risk. However, the variable could  still be useful in the model. </p> <p>With this information, the next step is to build a base model and evaluate it.  Even though the EDA has provided some insights, it can still be improved with  further analysis. </p>"}]}
