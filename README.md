## ðŸ§ Project overview 

This project aims to build a credit classification model which predicts whether a credit applicant has 
a good or bad credit risk, based on personal and financial information. The implementation covers all 
the stages of a typical machine learning project: 

- Data loading via SQL queries. 
- EDA 
- Base model training and evaluation. 
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV. 
- Model evaluation with cross-validation. 
- Feature importance analysis with SHAP. 
- Model deployment with FastAPI.
