[SHAP](https://shap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a powerful tool for interpreting
machine learning models, as it provides insights into how each feature contributes 
to the predictions. This section contains the interpretability analysis of the 
model trained in the previous section. 

### Understanding SHAP values 

The SHAP summary plot displays the impact each feature has on the model's 
predictions. Each point represents a single prediction, and the color 
indicates the feature value (red for high, blue for low). The x-axis shows 
the SHAP value, that is, how much that feature contributed to pushing the 
prediction towards a good or bad credit rating.

This plot can be used to extract some interesting insights about the model: 

- The most important features for the model are `Status_of_existing_checking_account`,
`Duration_in_month`, `Purpose` and `Credit_amount`. This aligns with domain knowledge, 
- as these variables are typically relevant in assessing creditworthiness. 

- Higher values of `Duration_in_month` lead to a higher probability of the model 
giving a bad credit rating, while the opposite happens when the value of this 
variable is low. This indicates that the model has learned a positive correlation 
between credit duration and risk of default. 

- While high amounts of credit can lead the model to give a bad credit rating, the 
plot is not conclusive, as there is significant overlap between the SHAP values 
for high and low credit amounts. This suggests that this variable alone is not a 
strong predictor, and it may depend on interactions with other features. 

- The `Age` feature shows a clear monotonic pattern, with higher ages leading to a 
better credit rating, while lower ages lead to a worse credit rating. This may reflect 
assumptions about financial stability and responsibility which tend to increase with age.

- Interestingly, beign a foreigner worker seems to contribute positively to the 
credit rating outcome, even though further demographic investigation would be needed 
to understand whether this reflects or not an actual pattern in the data. 


Overall, the SHAP analysis reveals that the model relies on both financial and 
demographic features to make its predictions. This interpretability analysis is essential
in credit scoring models, where decisions can have significant impact on individuals' lives. 
Ensuring that the model's behavior aligns with domain knowledge and ethical considerations
helps build trust, detect potential biases and comply with regulatory expectations.
