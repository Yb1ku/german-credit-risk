## ðŸ“‡ DATASET OVERVIEW 

The data used in this project is the 
[German Credit Data](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data) 
dataset, which contains information about credit applicants and their credit risk 
classification. The dataset consists of 1000 samples. There are 2 variations of the 
dataset: 

- **German Data**: Contains both categorical and numerical features. 
- **German Data Numeric**: Categorical features are encoded as numerical values. 
Suitable for models that require numerical inputs. 

This project uses the original **German Data** with categorical features. 

## FEATURES 

The dataset contains 20 features and a target variable. The features are a mix of 
categorical and numerical variables:

The next step is to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the 
underlying patterns and relationships in the data. This will help in feature 
selection and model building stages.
