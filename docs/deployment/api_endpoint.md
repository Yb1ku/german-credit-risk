Once the model is trained and evaluated, the next step in the pipeline is to 
deploy it as an API endpoint. This allows the model to be accessed and used 
without the need to run the codebase. In this project, the model is deployed 
locally using FastAPI, but it can also be deployed on a cloud service such as 
Render, Railway, Heroku, AWS, GCP or Azure.
